Password Validation - Rule 1

As a user, I must follow the pre-defined password rules while creating my account. According to Rule 1, the password must have a minimum of 8 characters. This ensures that the password is strong enough to offer basic security against unauthorized access. It is mandatory that all password rules are successfully passed for the password to be accepted. If any rule is not satisfied, the system will prompt the user to correct the input before proceeding.
