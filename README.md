Check first name

As a user, I should be able to enter a valid First Name during registration. The First Name must begin with a capital letter and contain at least three characters. This validation helps ensure that users provide proper and meaningful names, maintaining consistency and avoiding incorrect or incomplete entries in the system. If the input does not meet these criteria, the system should prompt the user to correct it before proceeding further.
