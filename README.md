Last Name Validation
This project validates a user's last name based on specific rules.

The last name must start with a capital letter and contain at least three alphabetic characters. It should not include any digits or special characters.

The regular expression used for validation is: ^[A-Z][a-zA-Z]{2,}$.

Some examples of valid last names are "Kumar" and "Sharma". Examples of invalid last names include "kumar" (starts with a lowercase letter), "Ku" (less than three characters), and "Kumar3" (contains a digit).
