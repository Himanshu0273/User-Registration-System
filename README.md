Email Validation Requirement
As a user, I must ensure that my email address is valid according to the defined rules. The system should be able to correctly validate and clear all email samples that are provided separately for testing. This means it must accurately accept valid email formats and reject invalid ones without errors. Proper email validation ensures that users provide correct contact information, improving the reliability and effectiveness of the registration system.
